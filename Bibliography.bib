Here, by incorporating direct human assessment of words, we quantify hap-piness levels on a continuous scale for a diverse set of large-scale texts: song titles and lyrics, weblogs, and State of the Union addresses. Our method is transparent, improvable, capable of rapidly processing Web-scale texts, and moves beyond approaches based on coarse categorization. Among a number of observations, we find that the happiness of song lyrics trends downward from the 1960s to the mid 1990s while remaining stable within genres, and that the happiness of blogs has steadily increased from 2005 to 2009, exhibiting a striking rise and fall with blogger age and distance from the Earth's equator.},

@article{Mikhaylov2012,
abstract = {The Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP) provides the only time series of estimated party policy positions in political science and has been extensively used in a wide variety of applications. Recent work (e.g., Benoit, Laver, and Mikhaylov 2009; Klingemann et al. 2006) focuses on nonsystematic sources of error in these estimates that arise from the text generation process. Our concern here, by contrast, is with error that arises during the text coding process since nearly all manifestos are coded only once by a single coder. First, we discuss reliability and misclassification in the context of hand-coded content analysis methods. Second, we report results of a coding experiment that used trained human coders to code sample manifestos provided by the CMP, allowing us to estimate the reliability of both coders and coding categories. Third, we compare our test codings to the published CMP "gold standard" codings of the test documents to assess accuracy and produce empirical estimates of a misclassification matrix for each coding category. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of coding misclassification on the CMP's most widely used index, its left-right scale. Our findings indicate that misclassification is a serious and systemic problem with the current CMP data set and coding process, suggesting the CMP scheme should be significantly simplified to address reliability issues.},

abstract = {This chapter moves on to a discussion of the material contained in the CD-ROM and of the ways in which this may be utilized and extended. The CD-ROM contains the data described in the earlier chapters, organized so as to facilitate the further analyses suggested there or in other appropriate investigations. We begin by describing data organization, and continue with suggestions about how this could be utilized to answer questions about party policy positions within and among the countries discussed in the text. We conclude with procedures for coding other party manifestos or related documents for MRG-type analyses. THE FILES The CD-ROM holds four types of files. Documentation files describe the pro-cedures used to create the policy indicators from the original party platforms and manifestos. These are in Adobe pdf format which can be accessed with the Acrobat 7 reader supplied on the CD-ROM. Data files hold the policy preference indicators. These appear in three formats: (a) Comma-delimited text, (b) Excel spreadsheets, and (c) SPSS 1 portable files. Text files include samples of the original material used by the MRG to produce the substantive policy codes underlying the analyses reported earlier in this book. Utility files include two programs designed to facilitate use of the documentation and data files by readers who do not have computer programs that can access these files. Each set of files will be described in turn.},

abstract = {Theoretical and empirical models of legislative decision making in parliamentary democracies typically neglect the policy preferences of individual MPs and instead focus on political parties and possible institutional constraints. We argue that MPs actually make judgments and decisions on the basis of their preferences, which are shaped by their personal characteristics. However, given the strength of parties in most parliamen- tary systems, the impact of personal characteristics on legislative behavior is rarely visi- ble. Therefore, we examine a moral issue. Looking at cosponsorship, parliamentary speeches, and votes in the German Bundestag, we analyze the legislative procedure on the regulation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Germany in 2011. We show that the legislative behavior of MPs does not only reflect partisan conflict but is also influenced by the preferences of the constituents andMPs' own personal character- istics such as: religious denomination, gender, and parental status.
